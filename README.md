*Movie Recommendation System using PySpark*

This project implements a movie recommendation system using PySpark, specifically the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. It utilizes the MovieLens dataset for training and testing the recommendation model.


**Dataset:**

The MovieLens dataset used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle dataset "MovieLens 25M Dataset". It contains ratings given by users to movies, as well as movie metadata.


**Usage:**

Install the necessary dependencies including PySpark.

pip install pyspark

Run the provided code in a PySpark environment. Make sure to replace the paths to the dataset files accordingly.

->The code preprocesses the data, trains an ALS recommendation model, and evaluates its performance using root-mean-square error (RMSE).

->Customize the code as needed for your specific use case or dataset.


**Requirements:**

Python 3.x

PySpark
